Film festivals are extremely crucial to the success of an independent film. Currently there is no central, well-designed tool for filmmakers to find festivals by date, location and fee. Film Festival Finder is an easy to use tool that meets this need by allowing filmmakers to find, save and add notes to their desired festivals.

Film Festival Finder was my first portfolio piece for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course. It was built using Javascript, Express.js, PostgreSQL, Node.js, CSS and HTML. It uses the Instagram API on both the individual festival pages and the about page.
